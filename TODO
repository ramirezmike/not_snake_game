TODO


(Levels)

(Gameplay)
- once a level is complete, if the player grabs a food maybe show the words "BONUS MODE" or something?
    or just make it clear they've reached the target like the letters turn color or something and get big and then small

(Audio)
- make electric snake only audibly buzz when you're near it and have the buzz get louder the nearer you are

(UI)
- make icon
- make quit buttons not appear in web mode
- score display should be like a "stats" view that shows what the player did in the past level. Maybe only show stuff that is greater than 0?
    # of foods
    # of bonus foods
    time taken
    # of deaths
    # of snake deaths?
    # of near-misses?


(Bugs)

(Release)

Stretch Goals
- add lights around food? (maybe make level-configurable size)
- add shaders on everything?

Sounds to add

Music to add
- everything
- make actual good music

Level Ideas
- make eye shape level

will not fix
- fix 40/60 fps issue (may be just what it is on this laptop)
- FIX BACKWARD SNAKE OMG (NOT GONNA DO THIS)
- make snake animate open/close mouth and have it open its mouth when it's near dude and try to close it when eating dude. There's like a weirdness where if the snake misses the dude it should re-open its mouth because it is still near the dude so like.. it has to bite but then quickly reopen all the way so it can bite again quickly

Done

- hide text when the game is over

- make food spawns more algorithmic and not random
- fix snake death animation
- change 3 snake level to a 1 snake level called Run and then later the same level again but with 3 called Run Run Run
