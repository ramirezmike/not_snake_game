TODO
- add camera shake
- fix snake death animation
- make dude scale up and down
- change 3 snake level to a 1 snake level called Run and then later the same level again but with 3 called Run Run Run
- make one big tutorial level with a snake in it too. Snake should really be in every level and make it clear that you can walk on snake
- make food spawns more algorithmic and not random
- make credits
- make icon
- make electric snake only audibly buzz when you're near it and have the buzz get louder the nearer you are
- make it so dude shrinks as he gets eaten but is still able to "escape" and let it be like 50% size or less you get eaten but before that you don't  
- make snake animate open/close mouth and have it open its mouth when it's near dude and try to close it when eating dude. There's like a weirdness where if the snake misses the dude it should re-open its mouth because it is still near the dude so like.. it has to bite but then quickly reopen all the way so it can bite again quickly
- animate between level score display screen
- make level/score screens have a button that is like "OK" or "Continue" to next screen
- make dude have like... little trailing poofs or something as he moves around
