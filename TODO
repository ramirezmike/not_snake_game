TODO
- re-add electric snake shader
    - might want to wait until there's a better bevy 0.6 example
- re-add food icon next to score? (not super important)
- change menu buttons' style
- add "endless mode"
- refactor level position code to use a trait
- fix performance bug when snake dies
- fix teleporting snake bug where the segments start to separate
    instead of "teleporting" just despawn the snake and re-spawn it at the other end
- start work on level editor
    - need to be able to mark blocks as not casting shadows
- add ability to control snake 
- FIX BACKWARD SNAKE OMG (TRY AGAIN, YOU CAN DO IT I BELIEVE IN YOU)
- Re-model snake or texture it so the inside of its mouth is black?



(Levels)

(Gameplay)
- once a level is complete, if the player grabs a food maybe show the words "BONUS MODE" or something?
    or just make it clear they've reached the target like the letters turn color or something and get big and then small
- Add "gates" that you can only pass after reaching target number of food 
- Snake foods can maybe be colored and indicate whether they speed up or slow down the snake?

(Audio)

(UI)
- make quit buttons not appear in web mode
- score display should be like a "stats" view that shows what the player did in the past level. Maybe only show stuff that is greater than 0?
    # of foods
    # of bonus foods
    time taken
    # of deaths
    # of snake deaths?
    # of near-misses?


(Bugs)

(Release)

Stretch Goals
- add lights around food? (maybe make level-configurable size)
- add shaders on everything?
- add Snake (Traditional) mode
- add Snake (Action) mode
- add Snake (Strategy) mode
- add camera shake

Sounds to add
- landing?
- lifting/dropping blocks

Music to add
- everything
- make actual good music

Level Ideas
- make eye shape level

will not fix
- fix 40/60 fps issue (may be just what it is on this laptop)
- make snake animate open/close mouth and have it open its mouth when it's near dude and try to close it when eating dude. There's like a weirdness where if the snake misses the dude it should re-open its mouth because it is still near the dude so like.. it has to bite but then quickly reopen all the way so it can bite again quickly

Done
- animate HUD
- redo level 2 to add places that player can fall 
- add meta stuff to hot reload like start level
- make foods without shadows
- freeze player when they die/finish level
- hide text when the game is over
- make food announce spawning somehow
- set snake path find to chase nearby player
- snake heads sometimes go backward 
- add FPS viewer
- fix dude movement so that it isn't frame based but also doesn't let you kick and then jump right after
- add sound system
- make exit announce spawning 
- add controller support
- make multiple colors/shades of blocks?
- make dude shrink when killed
- setup something to cull out of view blocks
- change exit flag to a different shape
- make menu work with controller and keyboard
- make yellow electric snake
- make death animation for falling out of bounds
- make death animation for electric snake
- make a layered donut level?
- make a tunnel level
- add pause screen
- make teleporter nodes
- make blocks that food can't spawn on
- make level titles
- add score display at end of level
- add secondary food that is for challenge
- set level title to show on level 1 (need to make it show during loading screen before the level asset is loaded so have to hardcode it)
- make level/score screens have a button that is like "OK" or "Continue" to next screen
- add keyboard direction arrows
- make it so dude can "cancel" a movement if they move in the opposite direction
- make dude scale up and down
- make dude have like... little trailing poofs or something as he moves around 
- add quit to menu in pause screen
- add restart level in pause screen
- make level title screen background match the next level
- make it so dude shrinks as he gets eaten but is still able to "escape" and let it be like 50% size or less you get eaten but before that you don't  
- make food spawns more algorithmic and not random
- fix snake death animation
- change 3 snake level to a 1 snake level called Run and then later the same level again but with 3 called Run Run Run
- make one big tutorial level with a snake in it too. Snake should really be in every level and make it clear that you can walk on snake
- add a "snake chases food then chases tail" snake behavior
- check licenses of everything used
- animate between level score display screen
- make credits
- make electric snake only audibly buzz when you're near it and have the buzz get louder the nearer you are
- make icon
- change font
- change the way we're loading files so that when the game launches it's only waiting on what's on the title screen.
    - the .ogg format is the bottleneck, so only load one music file
- update bevy and re-add visibility on buttons in main menu
